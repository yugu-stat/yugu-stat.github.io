This R package implements a nonparametric maximum likelihood method described in Lin et al. (2021) for assessing potentially time-varying vaccine efficacy (VE) against SARS-CoV-2 infection under staggered enrollment and time-varying community transmission, allowing crossover of placebo volunteers to the vaccine arm. It has been released on [CRAN](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fcran.r-project.org%2Fweb%2Fpackages%2FiDOVE%2Findex.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw1QQf6tcFecZQ3oAfyiW05a).
