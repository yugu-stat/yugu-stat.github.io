This R package implements the two robust methods described in Lin et al. (2023+) to assess the totality of evidence for the treatment effects on the entire clinical course of a patient using daily clinical outcomes. In addition, we develop a SAS macro that fits marginal proportional hazards models for multiple events and combines the evidence of treatment effects using the Wei, Lin and Weissfeld (1989, JASA) method.
