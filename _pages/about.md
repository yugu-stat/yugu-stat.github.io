I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics & Actuarial Science](https://saasweb.hku.hk/) at the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). I received my PhD in Biostatistics from the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) in 2023, co-advised by Drs. [Danyu Lin](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/danyu-lin-phd/) and [Donglin Zeng](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/donglin-zeng-phd/). Before that, I graduated with a BS in Statistics from the [University of Science & Technology of China](https://sgy.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2018.

Research Interests
======
- **Survival analysis:** I study semiparametric regression models for complex censored outcomes, with a focus on interval-censored failure times and multi-state processes. I also develop methods for integrative analysis of survival, longitudinal, and imaging data to enhance risk prediction in chronic diseases. Moreover, I am broadly interested in statistical applications of survival analysis in medicine and public health.    
- **Statistical machine learning:** I develop novel machine learning methods tailored to survival outcomes, with a special interest in transfer learning for survival analysis. I also investigate deep learning approaches for flexible nonparametric and semiparametric inference with censored data.
- **Functional data analysis:** Together with my colleagues, I develop novel methods for analyzing complex functional and longitudinal data, particularly those with informative observation times and latent structures.

Openings
======
- I have several **PhD** positions. Please email me your CV and transcript if you are interested. Applicants with strong mathematical background and computational skills are preferred. Please understand that due to the high volume of inquiries, I may not be able to respond to each email individually.  
- I have one **Postdoc** position. Please email me your CV if you are interested. Applicants from all research areas, with at least one first-authored statistical paper published or under revision, will be given full consideration.
