I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics & Actuarial Science](https://saasweb.hku.hk/) at the [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). I received my Ph.D. in Biostatistics from the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) in 2023, co-advised by Drs. [Danyu Lin](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/danyu-lin-phd/) and [Donglin Zeng](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/donglin-zeng-phd/). Before that, I graduated with a B.S. in Statistics from the [University of Science & Technology of China](https://sgy.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2018.   

Research Interests
======
My primary research interests lie in survival analysis and semiparametric inference. Recent work includes semiparametric regression analysis of interval-censored multi-state data, evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine/treatment effectiveness, joint modeling of multi-state and longitudinal data, and variable selection for interval-censored data. 

In addition, I am broadly interested in statistical applications to Alzheimer's disease, breast cancer, mental disorders, and oral diseases.

🧑‍🎓 I have two fully funded PhD positions, one to start in Year 2024/2025 and another one to start in Year 2025/2026. We will work together on exciting problems at the interface of survival analysis, machine learning, functional/imaging data, and network analysis. Please drop me an email with your CV if you are interested in joining my group!
